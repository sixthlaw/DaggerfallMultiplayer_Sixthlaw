### What's in the latest update?:
#### V0.1 Enemy Synchronization in Dungeons
Enemy synchronization has been extended to work in dungeons! Previously, enemy synchronization only functioned in the overworld. 

Now players can experience fully synchronized enemy encounters in both overworld and dungeon environments, making multiplayer dungeon crawling a truly cooperative experience.

### Important: 
This mod is based on DFU 0.14.5 code - so you may have issues playing this version of the game with mods. We're currently working on getting it updated to work with the latest version of DFU. Stay tuned!

### Shout-outs ~~

Based on the original multiplayer work by Tanguy <3 - you can find his REPO here: https://github.com/EmptyBottleInc/DFU-Tanguy-Multiplayer

As it's been 3 years since the last update, we're carrying on the torch here! We love you Tanguy. More updates inbound in the coming weeks. 

The original DFU code is not from me, this is copied 0.14.5 code from [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity).

You can be informed of the newest versions of the Daggerfall base game [here](https://www.dfworkshop.net/).
