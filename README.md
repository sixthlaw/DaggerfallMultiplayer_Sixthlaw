# DFU-Tanguy-Multiplayer

### Daggerfall Unity

The original code is not from me, I copied the 0.14.5 code from [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity).

You can be informed of the newest versions [here](https://www.dfworkshop.net/).

I hope making this project a mod for the original version, but for now this is a "Custom Build".

Here is a Tutorial to setup the thing to play online with steam [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEvdcE6smFQ).
