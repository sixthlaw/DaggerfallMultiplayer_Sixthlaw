# Daggerfall Multiplayer (by Sixthlaw)

Based on the work by Tanguy

### Daggerfall Unity

The original code is not from me, I copied the 0.14.5 code from [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity).

You can be informed of the newest versions [here](https://www.dfworkshop.net/).

I hope making this project a mod for the original version, but for now this is a "Custom Build".

Here is a Tutorial to setup the thing to play online with steam [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEvdcE6smFQ).

### Recent Updates

#### Enemy Synchronization in Dungeons
Enemy synchronization has been extended to work in dungeons! Previously, enemy synchronization only functioned in the overworld. Now players can experience fully synchronized enemy encounters in both overworld and dungeon environments, making multiplayer dungeon crawling a truly cooperative experience.
